# 👋 Welcome!

This is a PWA using Mkdocs material theme

## ⚡️ Performance Optimizations

- Network-first PWA (offline-use possible)
- Minifying & combining CSS/JS
- Lazy loading images
- Prefetching links
- Using katex instead of mathjax
- `content-visibility: auto`

## Why PWA?

PWA are applications that have been designed to be capable, reliable, and installable with a single codebase.

Using a PWA in this case allows the contributors of the website and I to ensure legible and understandable content, without worrying about the app development.
