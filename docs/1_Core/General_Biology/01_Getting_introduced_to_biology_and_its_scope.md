## Getting introduced to biology and its scope

- List of steps in biology to conclude a statement: Observation, Question, Hypothesiis, Prediction, Experiment. (Pnemonic : OQHPE) ; If the experiment does not support hypothesis then make a new one. If it supports hypothesis, make new predictions. 
- List of major life charecteristics: Order, Regulation, Growth and Development, Energy Processing, Response to Environment, Reproduction, Evolution. (Pnemonic : ORGERRE)
- List of major themes in biology : Energy Processsing, Structure and Function, Information Flow, Evolution, Interconnection to other systems. (Pnemonic : ESIEI)
- Classifiication of Life from small to big : Molecules and Atoms, Organelles, Cells, Tissues, Organs , Organ System, Organisms, Population, Communities, Ecosystem, Biosphere. 

Eubacteria : 
- Small, Prokaryotic, Single celled organisms ranging from 1 - 10um. 
- Lack nucleus and cell membrane bound organelles. 
- Cell wall contains a complex organic molecule called peptidoglycan. 

#### Archea: 
- Prokaryotic
- Cell membrane has Isoprenes. 
- Extremophiles 
- Has large proportions of genes that are diff from eubacteria.

Protists : Microscopic Organisims like Amoeba and Seaweed.

Kingdoms are distinguished as: 
- Plantae : Produce their own food. 
- Animalia : Obtain food by ingesting and digesting. 
- Fungi : Decomposers, obtain food by decomposing dead and decaying organic matter. 

Prokaryotes have: 
- Pilli : Short projections for attachment to surfaces. 
- Flagella : Long projections to propel them through their liquid environment. 
- Capsules : Makes the bacteria's surface more slippery, helping it to escape engulfment by phagocytic cells.

- Only Animal cells have Lysomes and Plant Cells have Chloroplasts.
