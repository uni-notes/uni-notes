## (Course Handout - Components of the cell and its internal workings): 

- Animals store excess glucose in the form of Glycogen. 
- Cellulose can't be digested by humans only ruminating animals like cows can do so thru the help of the microorganisims in their intestines which help them break them down. Altho we can't digest it, it is good for us as the lining of our intestines secrete mucus which allows food to pass freely.
- A pound of fat contains more than the twice the amount of energy as compared to a pound of carb. The downside is it's very hard to get rid of them as they are stored deep in our adipose tissues which swell or shrink as we deposit or withdraw fat from them.
- Unsaturated fatty acids are those which have fewer than the max number of hydrogen atoms. They appear bent. For a fat to be saturated all 3 components need to be straight.
- Sometimes a food manufacturer wants to use vegetable oil but wants the end product to be solid, in that case adds hydrogen, this process is called hydrogenation. Unfortunately, hydrogenation also leads to trans fat which are very detrimental to our health. Some fats like omega 3 are very healthy for us, these are found in foods like nuts and salmons.
- Cholesterol is a base steroid on top of which other hormones like testosterone is made. Anabolic steroids mimic testosterone, these are given to treat diseases like cancer and AIDS, but athletes abuse this and the use of this has dangerous side effects such as depression, liver damage, violent behavior.
- Changing one element's sequence in proteins can be very detrimental as it affects the proteins ability to function. Eg. Substitution of one amino acid in hemoglobin incorrectly results in sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder.
- High Fever are dangerous for this very reason as with the inc in temp, the proteins tend to lose their shape.

Linking of Ribonucleic Acid can be represented as: <br>
- A - T <br>
- G - C 

Difference between RNA and DNA: <br>
- Ribonucleic<br>
- Instead of Thymine base, RNA has Uracil <br>
- RNA is usually found in living cells in stranded form, whereas DNA usually exists as a double helix.

Termninology: <br>
- Starch is Amylose <br>
- Indigestible fibres are called cellulose.<br>
- Animal starch is called glycogen.
