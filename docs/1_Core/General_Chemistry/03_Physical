- **Physical Chem**

        - Energy can be transferred between systems in discrete amts only
        - Radiation (light) has a particle character
        - Electron has a wave character
            - **Planks Law**
                
                The internal modes of atoms and molecules can posses only certain energies 
                
                the modes are quantized

                **The photoelectric effect**
                
                - No electrons are ejected regardless of the intensity of the radiation unless its frequency exceeds a threshold value characteristic of the metal
                - The kinetic energy of the ejected electron increases linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation but is independent of the intensity of radiation
                - Even at low light intensities, electrons are ejected immediately if the frequency is above the threshold
                - According to conversation of energy,

                    where 1/2meV^2 is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron 
                    
                    hv is the energy of the photon 
                    
                    theta is the work function ( characteristic of the metal ) - energy required to remove an electron from the metal “to infinity and beyond”

                - Diffraction of electrons by a single crystal of Ni
                - Diffraction is the interference caused by an object in the path of waves
                - Depending on whether the interference is constructive or destructive , the result is a region of enhanced or diminished intensity  of the wave
                - particles are wave-like
            - **Wave-Particle Duality**
                
                Any particle travelling with a linear momentum p=mv should have a wavelength lambda.

                particle with high linear momentum has short wavelength 
                
            - **Matter wave and de Broglie's relation**
                
                Matter wave is expressed as

                The de-broglie relation implies that the wavelength of a matter wave should decrease as the particles speed increases
                
                Large particles only manifest their particle nature and never their wave nature because their momenta will be so high due big mass making their wavelengths very small 
                
            - **Dynamics of microscopic systems**
                
                **According to classical mechanics** a particle has specific trajectory
                
                position and momenta are specified at each instant
                
                **According to quantum mechanics** a particle cannot have specific trajectory
                
                The wavefunction determines the probability distribution , darker the area higher the probability of finding the particle

        Correction :- B2H6 is IR active because of selection rule
        
        In quantum mechanics, a selection rule is a criterion that determines whether a particular physical process or transition is allowed or forbidden. It specifies the conditions under which a transition can occur between two energy states of a system. In the context of spectroscopy, selection rules determine which types of transitions are observable in a particular spectroscopic technique, such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy.
        
        IR spectroscopy is based on the absorption or emission of infrared radiation by molecules. It involves transitions between different vibrational energy levels of the molecules. The selection rule for IR activity is known as the electric dipole selection rule. According to this rule, for a molecule to exhibit an infrared absorption, the vibrational mode must result in a change in the molecular dipole moment.
        
        Now, let's consider the molecule B2H6, which is called diborane. Diborane consists of two boron atoms (B) and six hydrogen atoms (H). In this molecule, the B-B bond is symmetrical, and the H atoms are arranged symmetrically around the boron atoms. Due to this symmetry, some vibrational modes of B2H6 do not result in a net change in the dipole moment of the molecule and, therefore, do not produce infrared absorption. These modes are said to be "IR inactive."
        
        However, there are vibrational modes in B2H6 that do result in a change in the dipole moment and satisfy the electric dipole selection rule. For example, the bending vibrations of the BH3 groups and the stretching vibrations of the B-H bonds involve changes in dipole moment and are therefore IR active. These modes can be observed in the infrared spectrum of B2H6.
        
        In summary, the selection rule for IR activity requires a change in the molecular dipole moment for a vibrational mode to be observable in the infrared spectrum. B2H6 exhibits IR activity for certain vibrational modes that involve changes in the dipole moment, such as the bending and stretching vibrations
