Corporations face multiple decisions, but have to pick wisely due to limited capital.

## Capital Budgeting

Process of evaluating firm’s long-term nvestment opportunities

Large investments usually consist of smaller investment decisions.

## Framework

1. Generation of investment idea
2. Estimation of cash flows
3. Select the appropriate opportunity cost of capital
4. Selection of ideas based on acceptance criteria
5. Re-evaluation

## Types of Investments

- Revenue-enhancement
- Cost-reduction
- Mandatory [government] investments to meet regulations

## Net Present Value (Primary)

It is in currency

One of 

$$
\text{NPV} = \text{PV(Inflows)} - \text{PV(Outflows)}
$$

| NPV  | Meaning                                  | Decision       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| $>0$ | Actual returns > Minimum required return | Accept         |
| $<0$ | Actual returns < Minimum required return | Reject         |
| $0$  | Actual returns = Minimum required return | Doesn’t matter |

## IRR (Primary)

Internal Rate of Return

$$
\text{IRR} = \text{Rate @ which NPV is 0}
$$

Actual return of your project

We only know cashflows; no interest rates

## Profitability Index (Secondary)

$$
\text{PI} = \frac{
\text{PV(Inflows)}
}{
\text{PV(Outflows)}
}
$$

For every 1 unit of investment

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Additional value generated after taking minimum returns} \\
&= (\text{PI} - 1) \times \text{Original Investment}
\end{aligned}
$$

| NPV  | Meaning                                  | Decision       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| $>1$ | Actual returns > Minimum required return | Accept         |
| $<1$ | Actual returns < Minimum required return | Reject         |
| $1$  | Actual returns = Minimum required return | Doesn’t matter |

## Discounted Payback Period (Secondary)

$$
\text{DPP} = 
$$

### Disadvantages

- Subjective payback period
- Only focusing on short-term gains
