## Artificial Intelligence

AI is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which are capable of behaving, thinking and making decisions like a human.

## Key Areas

1. Machine Learning
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Robotics
4. Object Detection
5. Speech Recognition

## Applications

1. Fashion and Art
2. Science
3. Games
4. Music and Sounds
5. Videos and Images  
6. Business and Finance
7. Security and Safety and the list goes on...

## Why AI?

- Replicate human intelligence to provide precise decisions and outcomes
- Solve knowledge-intensive tasks to reduce human workload
- Establish an intelligent connection of perception and action

## Types

There are 2 types of artificial intelligence

|              |                         ANI                         |               AGI               |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|  Full form   |           Artificial Narrow Intelligence            | Artificial General Intelligence |
|   Concept    | Specific Task<br />eg: Self-driving car, web search |   Do anything a human can do    |
| Advancements |                        Rapid                        |              Slow               |

## Limitations

Don’t be too optimistic or pessimistic about AI

1. Performance
2. Explainability
   
   AI finds it hard to justify its decisions
3. Biases due to biased data
4. Attacks on AI
5. Adverse use of AI

## AI Company

This section is not relevant from the AI courses as such, but is important to know.

Company + deep learning $\ne$ AI company

### Features

1. Strategic data acquisition
   1. some companies release non-monetised products just for data collection
2. Unified data warehouse
   1. makes it easier to connect and link
3. Task Automation
4. New roles (ML engineer) and division of labor

### Roles

Roles aren’t concrete

1. Software engineer - program/task execution
2. ML engineer - Trains the neural network
3. ML researcher - extend state-of-the-art in ML
4. Applied ML scientist - does roles of ML engineer and researcher
5. Data scientist
   1. examine data
   2. provide insights
   3. presentations
6. Data engineer
   1. organize data
   2. ensure data security, accessibility and cost-efficiency
7. AI product manager
   1. decide what to build
   2. feasibility and value

### Transformation

Steps for a company to transform into an AI company

1. pilot projects

   1. focus on success rather than value of pilot projects
   2. some sort of progress in 6-12 months
   3. In-housed/outsourced
2. in-house AI team
3. AI training to all employees

   Curate (online courses, books, etc) instead of create training
4. AI strategy
   1. use AI to create an advantage specific to the required sector
   2. aligned with ‘Virtuous Cycle of AI’

```

   3. data strategy
      1. strategic data acquisition
      2. unified data warehouse
   4. network effects and platform advantages
   
   		Eg: social media - more users join, more lucrative for prospective users
5. communications
   everyone should be aligned with how company is ‘navigating' with AI
   1. internal
   2. external
      1. investors
      2. governments
      3. customers
      4. talent

### Projects

Outsource whatever does not require specialisation/customisation - especially industry-standards

### Choosing a project

#### Brainstorming

1. Automate tasks instead of automating jobs
2. what are the main drivers of business value
3. what are the main recurring weak points in your business

#### Proofing

- Techincal Diligence - AI experts
  - AI must be able to perform
  - how much data is required
  - resources required
- Business diligence - domain experts
  - valuable
  - does it
    - lower costs
    - increase revenue
    - allow to launch new product/business
- Ethical diligence
  - does it benefit/harm society

#### Implementing

1. Specify acceptance criteria
   1. do not expect 100% accuracy
      1. limitations of ML
      2. Insufficient data
      3. mislabelled data
      4. ambiguous labels
   2. provide AI team with 
      1. training set
      2. test set
   3. to measure performance
   4. Eg: 95% accuracy
