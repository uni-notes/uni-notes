# Internet of Things

Covers solid technical knowledge and skills to build Internet of
Things (IoT) systems. IoT has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies -
embedded systems, sensor technology, real-time data analytics, machine learning, etc. Traditional fields of
embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building
automation), and others all contribute to enabling the IoT.

This course comprehensively covers various
technologies and tools used for enabling IoT solutions. Knowledge of various topics required for building
IoT prototypes like sensors and actuators/ Communications and networking and data management is also
imparted in this course. This course would also help the students understand the various IoT security
challenges and solutions to address them.

The course will also give the students exposure to how various
real-world problems are being solved by IoT-based solutions (like in applications for smart cities smart
farming, etc.). There would also be some hands-on sessions where students would learn how to build and
program IoT systems and make end-to-end solutions for different applications.
