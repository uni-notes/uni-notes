    "The estimated coefficient on goals_for is 0.003. This means that an additional goal scored by the team will increase the team's winning percentage of 0.003. The estimate on the intercept is -0.1781. This means that without scoring any goal, the winning percentage for the team would be -0.1781. As we know, the winning percentage cannot be negative. The reason we get a negative estimate on the intercept is because in our sample, there is not a single game where a team scored zero goals.\n",

Comparing the t-statistics with the student t distribution, if 95% of the t distribution is closer to the mean than the t-statistics, we will have p-value of 0.05, which is also referred to a 5% significance level. A p-value no more than 0.05 (5%) is generally accepted in rejecting the null hypothesis. We say that the estimated coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level.\n",
