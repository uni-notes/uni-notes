# Task $T$

Process of learning itself is not the task; learning is the means of attaining ability to perform the task

Usually described in terms of how the machine
learning system should process an instance (collection of features), which is usually represented as a vector.

## Regression

Process of predicting continuous values.
$$
\hat y = f(X)
$$

## Classification

Supervised learning technique, which works with labelled dataset

Deals with categorical data

In a classication dataset, you have

- Independent attributes $<A_1, A_2, A_3>$

- Discrete Target attribute

- Tuples/records/data objects/sample instance

  Tuple $= (x, y)$

    - $x =$ Feature Vector
    - $y =$ Class Label
