You should never compare money across different time instants. We can only compare at the same instant.

| When we take cashflow ___ in time | Name        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| forward                           | compounding |
| backward                          | discounting |

Return for every investment is a compensation

- Time
- Inflation
- Risk

$$
\begin{align}
\text{FV} &= \text{PV} \cdot \underbrace{(1+r)^t}_{\text{Compound Factor}} \\
\text{PV} &= \frac{\text{FV}}{(1+r)^t} \\
&= \text{FV} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}}_\text{Discount Factor}
\end{align}
$$

In a finance interview, if you’re not sure of the answer, just say it’s compounding 😭😂
