## Need for history

1. give examples for theory
2. justifications for proposals and ideas
3. To understand the present
   Lot of conflicts in middle east are due to WW1
4. Notice patterns

## WW1

started in Europe

High speed of industrialization

everyone believed that the best way to progress was through industrialization

### Germany

dissatisfied

get surrounded by its enemies quickly

### Reason

1. nationalism
   1. want an empire
2. Franz Ferdinand got assassinated
   The political objective of the assassination was to free Bosnia of Austria-Hungarian rule and established of a common South Slav ("Yugoslav") state. The assassination precipitated the July crisis which lead to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and the start of the First World War

### Parties

| Allies (west)    | Alliance (germany)                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| US (joined late) | Germany                                |
| france           | Austro-hungary                         |
| russia           | Italy (switched sides from the allies) |
| UK               | Ottoman empire                         |
| China            |                                        |
| Japan            |                                        |

Italy switched sides cuz it felt like it didn't get much from the war, even though it did a lot

Why US joined WW1

mostly financial

1. to get european allies by supporting
2. maritime - Germany blockade of ships
   Germany sank many American merchant ships around the British Isles, using submarines, prompting the American entry into the war.

### Far East

China v Japan were having an ongoing conflict over territory

Both Japan and China were with the Allies against germany and Austria-hungary

#### China

basically china wanted to help the Allies in exchange for help with land disputes with japan

#### Japan

Japan already had a military alliance with Britain, but that did not obligate it to enter the war. It joined the Allies in order to make territorial gains: because they wanted to acquire the lands in Far East under German control

## WW2

### Reasons

1. Treaty of Versailles was too unfair to Germany
   At the end of WW1, the entire reparation costs and blame was put on Germany, even though they could not afford to do so
2. The people felt very embarassed and angry and hence wanted to change
   Hitler used this angst as fuel for his propaganda
3. Hitler's occupations and torturing of jews and communists

### Parties

| Allies | Axis    |
| ------ | ------- |
| France | Germany |
| UK     | Italy   |
| US     | Japan   |
| Soviet |         |
| China  |         |

US and Soviet were together?! :open_mouth:

### Why did Japan join axis

It wanted to become independent from the western world

### End of WW2

When Germany had already retreated, Japan was still trying to fight.

Japan bombed pearl harbour; US bombed hiroshima and nagasaki using an atomic bomb.

### Why did US actually end up using the atomic bomb

US claimed that it just wanted to get everything over with and this marked the end of the war.

However, many experts say that US just wanted to try out the bomb to research further about it. This claim is supported by the fact that the first people to reach the site after the bombing were actually researchers like Richard Feynmann

### US and Soviet

Another theory about why US used the bomb is to show it's superiority, because the soviets were also developing nuclear weapons at the time. US didn't even tell soviets about the bombing, because they didn't want the soviets to get there first.

After WW1 and WW2, naked expansion has been frowned upon. Previously, colonialism and expansion of territories was accepted

## Ind

### Naxalite–Maoist Insurgency

insurgency (violent, armed rebellion against authority)

fought for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural laborer and the poor

### Siachen Glacier

gives India the “tactical advantage of dominating height.” Sitting at much lower altitudes, Pakistani soldiers are completely “shut off from a view of the Siachen Glacier” and are thus at a “severe tactical disadvantage” all along the AGPL. Demilitarizing the glacier would amount to India surrendering its advantage.

### Kargil War

Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. However, in 1984, India violated agreements and acquired the entire Siachen glacier. This provoked Pakistan to fight.

## Cold War

### Communism

Communism from Russian Revolution

There are 2 class - haves / have-nots

fight for

1. resources
2. power
3. politics

#### Reason against communism

have nots believed that the only way is by a ***violent*** uprising. the world govts got afraid

they believed that there shouldn’t be a ‘state’

#### Reason for communism

because the people benefit

### Context

idealogical conflict - war of ideas - fight of who's way of life is better
capitalism vs communism
other wars were mostly about expanding territory/exploiting resources of a particular territory

India tried being non-aligned because india was fed up of fighting others' wars; it just wanted to be independent from others; but actually comes closer to Soviet Union, because US was closer to Pakistan

relatively non-violent

- nothing happened in europe, us, soviet
- violence happened in other countries through proxy wars

###  Europe

![germany cold war](img/germanyColdWar.png)

Iron Curtain was an idea/concept, not really a physical one; it represented the divide b/w the 2 ideologies

Western Germany was controlled by 3 countries after WW2

1. US
2. UK
3. France

### Berlin

![berlin cold war](img/berlinColdWar.png)

Berlin was an enclave (a portion of territory surrounded by a larger territory whose inhabitants are culturally or ethnically distinct; like Musandam in UAE)

itself was divided into east and west Berlin

everybody wanted to move to the west Berlin side because 'western' was considered to be better

### Korea

North freed by Soviet, South freed by US

### South-East Asia

- Vietnam
    - north - soviet
    - south - US
- Cambodia
- Laos

### Why did US hold on to Vietnam, even though it was losing?

it felt that if it retreated, then soviet would expand itself into the south also; then, they would further expand themselves into Cambodia and Laos as well

### Cuban Missile Crisis

Soviet places missile launch point in Cuba to attack US

US places missile launch point Turkey to attack Soviet

Nuclear ==deterrence==
nuclear weapons are intended to deter other states from attacking with their nuclear
like 2 equally powerful drug cartels opting for cooperation instead of demolition

### Afghanistan

Soviet established a pro-Soviet govt.

US supported the Mujahideen guerilla to fight against the Soviets.

### Collapse of Soviet Union

after the Chernobyl disaster, the govt opened up and everyone over-used the freedom they got and started asking for independence

Similar thing happening in north korea
if you give freedom, then people will take advantage

## Miscellaneous Points

### Militiary Coup

Militiary has the final power to protect the country

### Insurgence

people who target govt expecting a change; they aren't exactly terrorists cuz they don't cause civil harm

### Diplomats

you cannot attack diplomat in embassy; embassy are like enclaves

- Havana Syndrome
- Jamal Khashoggi

### UN Security council

countries which volunteer its military services for global issues

5 permanent members

10 elected members
