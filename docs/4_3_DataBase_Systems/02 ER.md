## Database Paradigms

- Relational (tables)
- Hierarchical (like tree)
- Network (interconnected)
- Object Oriented 
- Object-Relational
- ER (Entity-Relationship)
- NoSQL

## ER Model

A database can be modelled as

- entity set
- relationship sets

## IDK

Super key is any key that can uniquely identify a record

We don’t have to include foreign key for a relation

it is **implied** that the primary keys of the connected entities are the foreign keys for the relation

## Disjoint ‘is-a’

can be either this **or** that
