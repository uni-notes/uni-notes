| Financial Statement   | Understand  | Why important?                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Profit Loss Statement | Expensed    | Less profit this year<br/>Less Depreciation in Coming years<br/>Less assets in Balance Sheet |
| Balance Sheet         | Capitalized | More profit this year<br/>More depreciation in coming years<br />More assets in Balance Sheet |

## Cost of Fixed Asset

All expenses necessary to make asset ready for intented use

- Purchase price [Net ie after making adjustment for taxes(excluded), rebates, etc]
- Cost of site preparation
- Delivery and handling cost
- Installation cost
- Training/Professional fee

## Useful life of an asset

$$
\text{Useful Life} \le \text{Physical Life}
$$

Estimated based on
- Expected physical wear and tear
- Obsolescence (not used anmyroe
- Legal/limits on use assets

Expressed in terms of time period/production units (hrs, km)

## Depreciation

Means of cost allocation

Depreciation $\ne$ Valuation

### Methods of Depreciation

|                              | Straight-line                                                | Declining balance/<br />Written-Down value       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Depreciation<br />Amount $D$ | $\frac{\text{Original Asset Cost} - \text{Estimated Scrap Value}}{\text{Estimated Life of Asset}}$ |                                                  |
| Value at time $t$            | $V_0 - tD$                                                   | $V_0 (1-r)^t$<br />where $r =$ depreciation rate |
| Conclusion                   | Acceptable                                                   | Better                                           |
| Salvage Amount               | 0                                                            | $\ge 0$                                          |

### Accounting Treatment

|                                                              | Date | Particulars          | Amount |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | -------------------- | ------ |
| 1. Entry for purchase of asset                               |      | Asset A/C Dr.        |        |
|                                                              |      | To Bank A/C Cr.      |        |
| 2. Entries for providing depreciation at the end of each year |      | Depreciation A/C Dr. |        |
|                                                              |      | To Asset A/C Cr.     |        |
| 3. Entry for amount realized on sale of asset                |      | Bank A/C Dr.         |        |
|                                                              |      | To Asset A/C Cr.     |        |

#### Reasoning

Refer to [Accounting Equation](03_Process_of_Accounting.md#Accounting Equation)

1. Asset value inc; Bank (Asset) dec
2. Depreciation (Expense) inc; Asset value dec
3. Bank (Asset) inc; Asset value dec

## Types of Asset Values

| Value   | Meaning                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Salvage | Estimated asset value at the end of its useful life |
| Scrap   | Actual resale value at the end of its useful life   |
| Book    | Estimate asset value at any point in time           |

At the end of useful life

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Book Value} &= \text{Scrap Value} \\
\text{Net margin for asset resale} &= \text{Scrap value} - \text{Salvage value}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Law of Marginal Utility

$$
\text{Returns from consumption} \propto
\frac{1}{\text{Consumption Amount}}
$$

## Sinking Fund

“A sinking fund is an account a corporation uses to set aside money earmarked to pay off the debt from a bond or other debt issue”

- Long-term provision
- Short-term provision
