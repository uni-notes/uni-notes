## What is Econometrics?

How do we test economic theories are true using real-world data, using statistics.

## Types of Data

|                         | Experimental | Real-World |
| :---------------------: | :----------: | :--------: |
| Controlled Environments |      ✅       |     ❌      |

## Why Econometrics?

|         | Statistics        | Econometrics    |

| Analyze | experimental data | Real world data |

## Monetary Policy

Policy that deals with finances of a country; most importantly, the money supply.

## Currency

is just a medium of exchange.

It eliminates the need for ‘coincidence of wants’- that both parties agree to trade the exact goods and services which the other party also wants.

## Rationality

Decisions taken in order to maximize self-interest and happiness.

## Banking

Central bank regulates interest rates through [rapport rate](#rapport-rate).

In order to increase interest rate, (i think this missing part is central bank would increase rapport rate)

### Rapport Rate

Rate at which central banks lends to commercial banks

### Interest Rate

Rate at which commercial banks lends to the public.

#### Theory

- Inflation $\propto$ Money Supply $\propto$ $\frac{1}{\text{Interest Rate}}$
- Interest Rate $\propto$ Rapport Rate

However, this may **not always** be true

1. Interest Rate $\not \propto$ Rapport Rate
   Commericial banks may not follow the same as central bank, if they have high liquidity (lots of hot cash)
2. Inflation $\not \propto \frac{1}{\text{Interest Rate}}$
   People may not always spend more just because of higher money supply caused by lower interest rates

## Type of Relationships

- One-way
- Simultaneous

## Problems

### Noise

Randomness due to nature of the real world.

### Heteroskedasticity

Variance in distribution of possible outcomes will change over different time, location, settings.

This is the biggest problem when using observational data, rather than experimental data.

### Auto-Correlation

Tendency of a variable to be determined by its own past values.

Mostly happens in time-series.

## Overnight/Call Money Market

Short-term lending from central bank to commercial banks.

These interest rates are called call money rate. It will be different from the regular loans, and will change regularly.

> An interbank call money market is **a short-term money market which allows for large financial institutions to borrow and lend money at interbank rates**. The loans in the call money market are very short, usually lasting no longer than a week.

## Random Variable

Numerical outcome of a random event

There are multiple outcomes possible, and there exists an underlying probability distribution. Hence, for each possible outcome, there exists a corresponding probability.

2 random variables cannot perfectly correlated; otherwise it has some cause.

## Systematic Event

only one outcome is possible

$P(A)=1; P(A')=0$

numerical outcome of a systematic event is systematic variable

## Africa Case Study

People were dying due to malaria and dengue, as they were not having access proper shelter from the mosquitos.

The first idea was to increase their income, by proving them direct income transfer, because they would use that money to take care of themselves.

2 researchers at MIT studied these African Countries. These 2 researchers disagreed.

There were 2 communities

- One community was given direct income transfers
- One community was given nets

Giving nets was more effective, as the other community spent the money for other aspects such as food, baby requirements, purchasing books; they considered nets as a luxury.

## Psychological Theory of Consumption

Proposed by John Maynard Keynes

Assuming Consumption $\propto$ Income

$$
C = c + kI
$$

- $C$ is the total consumption
- $c$ is the basic consumption
    - $c \ne 0$
- $k$ is called the MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume)
    - $k \in [0, 1]$
- $I$ is the income
