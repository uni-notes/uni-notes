## Trickle-down Effect

The benefits of improving a particular country/sector will improve others also eventually

## Health of an economy

1. Real GDP/National Income (not GNP)
2. Inflation
3. Unemployment

## What is a Model?

Simplified representation of a system with assumptions

### Purpose

- simplify economic decisions
- how to change outcomes
- focus on what's important
- built with assumptions
- omits details

### Characteristics of a good model

1. Simple
2. Easy to work with
3. Insightful
4. Generalizable
5. Easy to test, and thereby accept/reject
6. Empirically consistent
7. Predictive precision

## Basic Economic Models

we are gonna learn 2 models

1. circular flow
2. production possibility frontier

## Circular Flow Model

More cycles $\implies$higher output

Cashless economy allows to complete more cycles
Credit card basically provides preponed salary; instigates flow from consumer sector to production sector

### Sectors of Economy

1. consumer
2. business/production
3. financial
4. Govt
5. external/foreign/international

All of these sectors are inter-linked and anything that affects one sector affects the others too

### 2 sector

Consumer and production

Production sector produces goods and services; consumers buy them

Production sector provides jobs; consumers work

### 3 sector

Financial sector provides investments to the producers

Consumers deposit the savings into the financial sector, and they gain more or assets go through depreciation

### 4 Sector

International sector allows

- imports/exports
- remittance(overseas transfers) - consumer the money sent back to the family in another country
- net lending overseas - financial sector gives out loans to other countries
- overseas income from foreign to all other sectors

### 5 sector

Govt

- consumers
    - collect taxes
    - provide direct income transfers (like pensions)
- business
    - collects taxes
    - govt purchases
    - transfer payments (tax holidays)
- financial sector

    - loans in times of govt deficit
    - liquidity injection
    Hot money/cash for the banks
- foreign sector
    - import duties/taxes

## Budget deficit leads to high inflation

When the govt spends a lot of money in development, then the demand for investment and labor will increase

Developing countries always try to spend more than their revenue, because they're trying to develop as quickly as possible

### Monetization of budget deficit

When the govt prints money/borrows from banks, instead of selling assets

This leads to inflation as there is more money in the system

## Duopoly

A situation with multiple buyers, but only 2 sellers

Nash equilibrium (by John Nash) says that

> An agent who has a competitor will always design the best policy, with the assumption that the competitor will also design its own best policy

### Prisoner's dilemma

(not in portion; just extra)
