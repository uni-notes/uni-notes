- Results
- Supplementary Materials (details)
- Code/Data (more details)

# Email

- Subject
  - Summarize findings in one sentence
- Email body
  - Brief description of problem
  - Recall what was proposed
  - Recall what was executed
  - Summary findings in 1-2 paragraphs
  - If you want to suggest future actions, make them concrete
  - If you have questions for them to address, make them yes/no

# Reproducible Research Checklist

✅ Start with good science

- Garbage in, Garbage out
- Coherent, focused question
- working with good collaborators
- Something that’s interesting to you

❌ Don’t use GUI softwares for analysis, as it is hard to reproduce

❌ Don’t do things by hand

- Using spreadsheets to perform operations
- Editing tables/figures manually

✅ Document unavoidable manual operations (not as easy at is it sounds)

- Downloading data from a website
- Moving data to outside project folder
- Splitting/reformatting data files

✅ Teach a computer to do tasks

- Downloading data

  ```R
  download.file("somelink/file.csv", "local_location/file.csv")
  ```

- Web scraping

✅ Use version control (such as Git)

- Helps slow down and perform tasks step by step
- Add changes in small chunks

✅ Keep track of software environment

- Write cross-platform code
  - For eg, in python be careful when working with paths. Use `os.path.join(folder, file)` instead of `folder + "/" + file`
- Computer Architecture
  - CPU, GPU specs
- Operating System
- Software toolchain
  - Compilers/Interpreter
  - Programming languages
  - Command shell
  - Database backends
  - Data analysis softwares
- Supporting software
  - Libraries
  - Packages
  - Dependencies
- External dependencies
  - Websites
  - Data/Software repositories
  - Remote databases
- Version Numbers

❌ Don’t save output independent of code

✅ Set your seed for random number generator
